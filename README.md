Approximate string matching library (with native bindings)

Levenshtein implementation taken from: https://github.com/arbovm/levenshtein

## Why

Because amatch unfortunately produces segfaults. I hope golang-to-C doesn't do that.

## Usage

```ruby
  require 'bmatch/similarities'
  Similarities.levenshtein_distance("aa", "a√º")
  Similarities.dice_similarity("night", "nacht")
```

## Contributing

Just send me a github pull request.
