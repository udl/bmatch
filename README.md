Approximate string matching library (with native bindings)

Inspired by

* https://github.com/flori/amatch

Levenshtein implementation taken from: https://github.com/arbovm/levenshtein

## Why

Because amatch unfortunately produces segfaults. I hope golang-to-C doesn't do that.

## Issues

* The build keeps segfaulting on travis-ci after the tests were green.
