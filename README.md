# bmatch

Approximate string matching library (with native bindings)

Inspired by
* http://blog.paracode.com/2015/08/28/ruby-and-go-sitting-in-a-tree/
* https://github.com/flori/amatch and https://blog.jcoglan.com/2012/07/29/your-first-ruby-native-extension-c/

Levenshtein implementation taken from: https://github.com/arbovm/levenshtein

## Why

Because amatch unfortunately produces segfaults. I hope golang-to-C doesn't do that.

## Usage

```ruby
  require 'bmatch/similarities'
  Similarities.levenshtein_distance("aa", "a√º")
  Similarities.dice_similarity("night", "nacht")
```

## Contributing

Just send me a github pull request.
